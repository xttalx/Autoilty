#### 1. Question-Based Content Strategy

**Target Queries:**

**Format Template:**
```html
<div class="featured-snippet-optimized">

    <p class="answer-paragraph">
        [Concise 40-60 word answer that directly addresses the question]
    </p>
    <h3>Key Points:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>[Point 1]</li>
        <li>[Point 2]</li>
        <li>[Point 3]</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

#### 2. Table-Based Comparisons

**Example: Winter Tire Comparison**
```html
<table class="comparison-table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Tire Brand</th>
            <th>Price Range</th>
            <th>Temperature Rating</th>
            <th>User Rating</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Bridgestone Blizzak</td>
            <td>$150-200</td>
            <td>-40°C</td>
            <td>4.7/5</td>
        </tr>
        <!-- More rows -->
    </tbody>
</table>
```

#### 3. Step-by-Step Guides

**Format for "How to" queries:**
```html
<div class="step-by-step-guide">
    <h2>How to Change Your Oil [Year] - Complete Guide</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Gather Materials:</strong> Oil filter, 5L oil, drain pan, wrench set</li>
        <li><strong>Warm Up Engine:</strong> Run for 2-3 minutes to thin oil</li>

### People Also Ask (PAA) Optimization

**Strategy:**

3. Format with clear H2/H3 tags
4. Include schema markup

**Implementation:**

// PAA Question Tracker
const paaQuestions = {
    "winter tires canada": [
        "When should I put winter tires on in Canada?",
        "Are winter tires mandatory in Canada?",
        "How much do winter tires cost in Canada?",
        "Can you use winter tires year-round?"
    ],
    "best car for winter": [
        "What is the best SUV for Canadian winter?",
        "Are AWD cars better in winter?",
        "Do I need winter tires with AWD?",
        "What features should I look for in a winter car?"
    ]
};

// Generate content sections for each PAA
function generatePAAContent(keyword) {
    const questions = paaQuestions[keyword];
    questions.forEach(q => {
        // Create H2 with exact question
        // Write 50-75 word answer
        // Add FAQ schema markup
    });
}
```

### Google Discover Optimization

**Content Requirements:**

### Voice Search Optimization

**Conversational Keywords:**

**Optimization Tactics:**
1. Use natural, conversational language
