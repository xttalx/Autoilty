# Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Strategy
## Dominating AI Search Results for Autoilty.com

### Overview
As AI search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Bard, and Bing Chat become primary information sources, optimizing for these platforms is crucial for visibility.

### Core Principles of GEO

#### 1. Authoritative, Factual Content
**AI models prioritize:**
- Verified facts and statistics
- Expert opinions and credentials
- Cited sources
- Recent, updated information
- Comprehensive coverage

**Implementation:**
```html
<article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Article">
    <header>
        <h1 itemprop="headline">Complete Guide to Winter Tires in Canada 2025</h1>
        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2025-01-10">
        <meta itemprop="dateModified" content="2025-01-10">
        
        <div itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person">
            <span itemprop="name">Dr. James Chen</span>
            <meta itemprop="jobTitle" content="Automotive Safety Expert">
            <meta itemprop="affiliation" content="Autoilty Community">
        </div>
    </header>
    
    <section class="fact-box">
        <h2>Key Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li data-fact="true">Winter tires required below 7°C</li>
            <li data-fact="true" data-source="Transport Canada">Mandatory in Quebec Dec 1 - Mar 15</li>
            <li data-fact="true">30% better braking on ice vs all-season</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
</article>
```

#### 2. Conversational Question-Answer Format

**AI models love Q&A structure:**

```markdown
## What are winter tires and why are they important?

Winter tires are specialized tires designed for temperatures below 7°C. They feature:

- Softer rubber compounds that remain flexible in cold weather
- Deeper tread patterns for better snow traction
- More sipes (small slits) for improved ice grip

They're important because they provide 30-40% better braking performance on snow and ice compared to all-season tires, significantly reducing stopping distances in Canadian winter conditions.

## When should I install winter tires in Canada?

Install winter tires when temperatures consistently stay below 7°C, typically:

- **British Columbia**: Late October to early November
- **Alberta**: Mid-October
- **Ontario**: November
- **Quebec**: Mandatory from December 1
- **Atlantic Provinces**: Late October to November

**Pro Tip from our community:** Don't wait for the first snowfall - tire shops get overwhelmed and you'll face 2-3 week waits.

## How much do winter tires cost in Canada?

Average costs based on 5,000+ community reports (2025):

- **Budget Range**: $100-150 per tire ($400-600 set)
  - Examples: General Altimax Arctic, Ironman iMOVE
  
- **Mid-Range**: $150-200 per tire ($600-800 set)
  - Examples: Michelin X-Ice, Bridgestone Blizzak
  
- **Premium**: $200-300+ per tire ($800-1,200+ set)
  - Examples: Nokian Hakkapeliitta, Continental VikingContact

**Installation costs**: $50-100 per season
**Storage (if needed)**: $80-150 per season
```

#### 3. Structured Data for AI Understanding

**Implement comprehensive schema markup:**
