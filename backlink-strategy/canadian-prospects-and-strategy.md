## 📊 TRACKING SYSTEM: ANCHOR TEXT VARIETY & NOFOLLOW BALANCE

### Anchor Text Distribution Guidelines

**Target Distribution:**
- **Branded (40%):** "Autoilty", "Autoilty.com", "Autoilty community"
- **Natural (30%):** "click here", "read more", "source", "this guide"
- **Partial Match (20%):** "Canadian auto community", "car forum Canada"
- **Exact Match (10%):** "best car forum", "auto directory Canada" (use sparingly!)

**Examples of Good Anchor Text:**
✅ "As featured on Autoilty.com"
✅ "According to Autoilty's community survey"
✅ "This comprehensive guide from Autoilty"
✅ "Read the full study at Autoilty.com"
✅ "Canada's largest auto community, Autoilty"
✅ "[Autoilty's mechanic finder tool](link)"

**Avoid:**
❌ "best car forum" (too exact match)
❌ "car directory" (over-optimized)
❌ "auto forum" (generic but overused)

### Nofollow Balance Strategy

**Target Ratio:**
- **Dofollow (70-80%):** Most links should be dofollow
- **Nofollow (20-30%):** Natural nofollow links are fine and expected

**Where Nofollow is Expected/Normal:**
- Forum signatures (often nofollow)
- Blog comments (usually nofollow)
- Social media links (nofollow)
- Some directory listings (mixed)
- User-generated content areas

**Where We Want Dofollow:**
- Guest post author bios
- Resource page links
- Directory listings
- Partnership links
- Expert quote citations
- Infographic attributions

**Strategy:**
- Don't ask to change nofollow to dofollow (red flag!)
- Mix is natural and healthy
- Focus on quality over follow/nofollow status
- Natural link profile has both

## 📅 QUARTERLY REVIEW CHECKLIST

**Every 3 Months, Review:**
- ✅ Anchor text distribution (should stay natural)
- ✅ Dofollow/nofollow ratio (should stay ~75/25)
- ✅ Link quality trends (DA distribution)
- ✅ Outreach success rates (which templates work best?)
- ✅ Content performance (what content earns most links?)
- ✅ Relationship status (who can we reach out to again?)

**Adjust Strategy Based On:**
- Which outreach templates get highest response
- Which content types earn most links
- Which sites are most receptive
- Seasonal opportunities (winter guides, summer road trips)

## 🏆 SUCCESS METRICS

**Monthly Targets:**
- **Links Acquired:** 20+ (goal: 20)
- **Average DA:** 25+ (quality over quantity)
- **Dofollow Ratio:** 70-80%
- **Canadian Sites:** 100% (all links from .ca or Canadian content)
- **Relevant Links:** 100% (all automotive-related)

**Quarterly Targets:**
- **Total Links:** 60+
- **High-Quality Links (DA 30+):** 15+

**Remember:** Quality > Quantity. One relevant, high-quality link from a Canadian auto site is worth more than 10 generic directory links.

Good luck! 🚗🇨🇦
