## 🚀 How It Works

### User Flow:

1. **User enters location** (e.g., "Toronto, ON" or "M5B 2A5")
2. **Optional: Select service type** (General, Oil, Brakes, etc.)
3. **Click Search**
4. **System searches Google Places API** for auto repair shops
5. **Results displayed** with ratings, reviews, services
6. **Map shows all mechanics** as markers
7. **Click markers** to see details in info window
8. **Click "View on Map"** to zoom to specific mechanic

### Technical Implementation:

- Uses **Google Places API** for searching
- Uses **Geocoding API** to convert addresses to coordinates
- Uses **Maps JavaScript API** to display the map
- Uses **Text Search** to find auto repair shops within 10km radius
- Stores markers in memory for efficient map interaction
