      content: `
        <h2>1. Set a Realistic Budget</h2>
        <p>Before you start shopping, determine how much you can afford. Consider not just the purchase price, but also insurance, registration, taxes, and ongoing maintenance costs. In India, factor in road tax, insurance premiums, and RTO charges.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Research Extensively</h2>
        <p>Use online resources to research makes, models, and years that fit your needs and budget. Check reliability ratings, fuel economy, safety scores, and common issues. Popular Indian brands like Maruti, Hyundai, Tata, and Mahindra offer excellent value.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Check Vehicle History</h2>
        <p>Always request vehicle documents including RC (Registration Certificate), insurance papers, and service records. Verify the vehicle's history through VAHAN portal and check for any pending loans or legal issues.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Inspect the Car Thoroughly</h2>
        <p>Even if you're not a mechanic, perform a basic inspection. Check for rust, paint inconsistencies, tire condition, and fluid levels. Look under the car for leaks and inspect the interior for wear and tear.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Get a Professional Inspection</h2>
        <p>Before finalizing any purchase, have a trusted mechanic inspect the vehicle. They can identify potential issues that aren't visible to the untrained eye and give you peace of mind or leverage in negotiations.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Test Drive Multiple Options</h2>
        <p>Don't settle for the first car you see. Test drive several vehicles to compare handling, comfort, visibility, and features. Pay attention to how the car feels on different road types and at various speeds.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Negotiate with Confidence</h2>
        <p>Do your research on fair market value for the specific make, model, year, and condition. Come prepared with comparable listings and be willing to walk away if the price isn't right.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Understand Financing Options</h2>
        <p>If you need financing, shop around for the best rates. Compare offers from banks, NBFCs, and online lenders. Pre-approval gives you negotiating power. In India, car loans typically range from 7-12% interest.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Review All Documentation</h2>
        <p>Carefully review the RC, insurance papers, service records, and any warranty information. Ensure all paperwork is in order and that the seller has legal authority to sell the vehicle. Verify the chassis and engine numbers match the documents.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Trust Your Instincts</h2>
        <p>If something feels off about the seller, the car, or the deal, trust your gut. There are always other cars available, and it's better to wait for the right opportunity than rush into a bad purchase.</p>

      title: "Buying Used Cars in Manitoba: Complete Guide",
      category: "Buying",
      excerpt: "Everything you need to know about purchasing used vehicles in Manitoba, including safety inspections, registration, and insurance requirements.",
      content: `
        <h2>Manitoba Vehicle Safety Inspection</h2>
        <p>All used vehicles in Manitoba must pass a safety inspection before registration. The inspection covers brakes, lights, tires, steering, suspension, and emissions. Ensure the seller provides a valid inspection certificate (valid for 12 months).</p>
        
        <h2>Registration Process</h2>
        <p>To register a vehicle in Manitoba, you'll need: proof of ownership (bill of sale), valid safety inspection certificate, proof of insurance, and valid driver's license. Visit a Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) office or authorized agent.</p>
        
        <h2>Insurance Requirements</h2>
        <p>Manitoba has public auto insurance through MPI. You must have basic Autopac coverage, which includes third-party liability, accident benefits, and uninsured motorist protection. Additional coverage options are available.</p>
        
        <h2>Best Practices for Manitoba Buyers</h2>
        <p>Check the vehicle's history through CarProof or Carfax, verify the VIN matches all documents, inspect for rust (common in Manitoba winters), and test drive in various conditions including highway and city driving.</p>
        
        <h2>Winter Considerations</h2>
        <p>Manitoba winters are harsh. Look for vehicles with good rust protection, check the battery condition, verify the heating system works, and ensure winter tires are available or included.</p>

      title: "Complete Guide to Car Maintenance: Keep Your Vehicle Running Smoothly",
      category: "Maintenance",
      excerpt: "Regular maintenance is key to extending your vehicle's life and preventing expensive repairs. Learn essential maintenance tasks and schedules.",
      content: `
        <h2>Regular Oil Changes</h2>
        <p>Oil changes are the most important maintenance task. Most modern cars need an oil change every 5,000 to 7,500 miles, but check your owner's manual for specific recommendations. Fresh oil keeps your engine lubricated and prevents costly damage.</p>
        
        <h2>Tire Care</h2>
        <p>Check tire pressure monthly and rotate tires every 6,000 to 8,000 miles. Proper tire maintenance improves fuel economy, handling, and safety. Replace tires when tread depth reaches 2/32 of an inch.</p>
        
        <h2>Brake System</h2>
        <p>Have your brakes inspected at least annually. Listen for squealing or grinding sounds, which indicate worn brake pads. Brake fluid should be flushed every two years or 24,000 miles.</p>
        
        <h2>Fluid Levels</h2>
        <p>Regularly check and top off engine coolant, transmission fluid, power steering fluid, and brake fluid. Each fluid has a specific interval for complete replacement - consult your manual.</p>
        
        <h2>Air Filter Replacement</h2>
        <p>Replace the engine air filter every 12,000 to 15,000 miles (or more frequently in dusty conditions). A clean air filter improves engine performance and fuel economy.</p>
        
        <h2>Battery Maintenance</h2>
        <p>Check battery terminals for corrosion and ensure connections are tight. Most car batteries last 3-5 years. If your battery is older, have it tested before winter.</p>
        
        <h2>Spark Plugs and Ignition</h2>
        <p>Modern spark plugs can last 100,000 miles, but older vehicles may need replacement every 30,000 miles. Follow your manufacturer's recommendations.</p>
        
        <h2>Timing Belt</h2>
        <p>The timing belt is critical - if it breaks, it can cause severe engine damage. Replace it according to your manufacturer's schedule (typically 60,000-100,000 miles).</p>

      title: "EV Maintenance: Electric Vehicle Care Guide",
      category: "Maintenance",
      excerpt: "Electric vehicles require different maintenance than gas cars. Learn how to care for your EV battery, charging system, and components.",
      content: `
        <h2>Battery Care</h2>
        <p>EV batteries degrade over time, but proper care can extend their life. Keep your battery charged between 20-80% for daily use, avoid frequent fast charging, and park in moderate temperatures when possible.</p>
        
        <h2>Charging Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Use Level 2 charging for daily needs and reserve DC fast charging for long trips. Install a home charging station for convenience. Keep charging ports clean and dry.</p>
        
        <h2>Reduced Maintenance Needs</h2>
        <p>EVs have fewer moving parts than gas vehicles. You won't need oil changes, spark plugs, or exhaust system maintenance. However, you still need to maintain tires, brakes, suspension, and cabin air filters.</p>
        
        <h2>Software Updates</h2>
        <p>Many EVs receive over-the-air software updates that improve performance, efficiency, and add features. Keep your vehicle's software up to date through the manufacturer's app or service center.</p>
        
        <h2>Winter EV Care</h2>
        <p>Cold weather reduces EV range. Pre-condition your vehicle while plugged in, use seat heaters instead of cabin heat when possible, and plan routes with charging stations in mind.</p>

      title: "How to Choose the Right Car Parts: OEM vs Aftermarket",
      category: "Parts",
      excerpt: "Understanding the difference between OEM and aftermarket parts can save you money while maintaining your vehicle's performance and reliability.",
      content: `
        <h2>What are OEM Parts?</h2>
        <p>Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts are made by the same company that manufactured your vehicle. They're identical to the parts installed when your car was new and typically come with a warranty.</p>
        
        <h2>What are Aftermarket Parts?</h2>
        <p>Aftermarket parts are made by third-party manufacturers. They're designed to fit and function like OEM parts but are often more affordable. Quality varies significantly between brands.</p>
        
        <h2>When to Choose OEM</h2>
        <p>Choose OEM parts when: warranty coverage requires it, safety is critical (brakes, airbags), you want guaranteed compatibility, or you prefer factory specifications. OEM parts are also better for newer vehicles under warranty.</p>
        
        <h2>When Aftermarket Makes Sense</h2>
        <p>Aftermarket parts are ideal when: you're on a budget, your vehicle is older, you want performance upgrades, or you're doing repairs that don't affect warranty. Many aftermarket parts offer equal or better quality at lower prices.</p>
        
        <h2>Research Brands</h2>
        <p>Not all aftermarket parts are equal. Research brands and read reviews. Well-known aftermarket manufacturers like Bosch, Denso, and ACDelco often produce high-quality parts comparable to OEM.</p>

        <h2>Consider Your Needs</h2>
        <p>For critical components like timing belts, water pumps, or suspension parts, OEM or premium aftermarket is worth the investment. For cosmetic items or non-critical components, quality aftermarket parts can save significant money.</p>
